# How to Run

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- Clone the this repository
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- setup the `.env` as seen in the env.example.txt file
- Run `npm run dev` to start the app
